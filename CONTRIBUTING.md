# Development

## Setup

Run `yarn` after checkout to install all dependencies.

## Tests

Tests can be run with `yarn test`.

Please add new tests for any new features and bug fixes.
Language-specific tests should be included in their respective `sqldialect.test.ts` files.
Tests that apply to all languages should be in `behavesLikeSqlFormatter.ts`.

## Publish Flow

For those who have admin access on the repo, the new release publish flow is as such:

- `npm run release` (bumps version, git tag, git release, npm release) (does not work with `yarn`).
- `git subtree push --prefix static origin gh-pages` (pushes demo page to GH pages)
